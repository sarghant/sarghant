Hi there. My name is Sargis and I am a frontend developer, although I also have knowledge of and some practice with server-side code (e.g., Node, Express, Mango) 
and in the past I even built a few apps with PHP + MySQL.
I am working on expanding my knowledge and honing my skills every day and I hope that my projects are a good display of my dedication to writing clean, efficient and error-free code.
